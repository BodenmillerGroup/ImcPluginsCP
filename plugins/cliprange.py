ClipRange
=============

**ClipRange**
Clips the maximum of an image by setting all values higher than an user defined percentile to the value of said percentile.
This is useful if an image has rare but strong outliers.

============ ============ ===============
Supports 2D? Supports 3D? Respects masks?
============ ============ ===============
YES          NO           YES
============ ============ ===============

See also
^^^^^^^^
Smoothing can also be used to address the outlier problem, e.g. with a median filter.

What do I need as input?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Can be a single or multichannel image. The filter will be applied per plane.


What do I get as output?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The filtered image.

Measurements made by this module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
No measurement will be made.
TODO: potentially record the percentile value that was used for truncating. However this can also be found by looking at the image maximal pixel value, thus it is likely not necessary.

Technical notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Nothing fancy done here.

# Constants
#
# It's good programming practice to replace things like strings with
# constants if they will appear more than once in your program. That way,
# if someone wants to change the text, that text will change everywhere.
# Also, you can't misspell it by accident.
#

#
# The module class.
#
# Your module should "inherit" from cellprofiler.module.Module, or a
# subclass of cellprofiler.module.Module. This module inherits from
# cellprofiler.module.ImageProcessing, which is the base class for
# image processing modules. Image processing modules take an image as
# input and output an image.
#
# This module will use the methods from cellprofiler.module.ImageProcessing
# unless you re-implement them. You can let cellprofiler.module.ImageProcessing
# do most of the work and implement only what you need.
#
# Other classes you can inherit from are:
#
# -  cellprofiler.module.ImageSegmentation: modules which take an image
#    as input and output a segmentation (objects) should inherit from this
#    class.
# -  cellprofiler.module.ObjectProcessing: modules which operate on objects
#    should inherit from this class. These are modules that take objects as
#    input and output new objects.
#

    # the category under which it is stored and the variable revision

    # you add user-interface functionality later.

    # by its superclass.

        #    ImageNameProviders in prior modules. Modules before yours will
        #    put images into CellProfiler. The ImageNameSubscriber gives
        #    your user a list of these images which can then be used as inputs
        #    in your module.
